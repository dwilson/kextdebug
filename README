Kext Debugging Tools

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These tools are provided to facilitate two-machine debugging for kernel
extensions (kexts) on Mac OS X.

capfile

Capistrano recipes to push a kext to the target machine, load it, and start
execution.

These recipes require Capistrano, a Ruby Gem that runs commands on a target
machine via SSH.

To get Capistrano (OS X already ships with Ruby Gems):
sudo gem install capistrano

To use the capfile, place it in the root of your kext project.  A list of
commands can be obtained by running:

cap -T

You can set environment variables 'target' and 'kext' to avoid data entry
when you run the cap commands.
